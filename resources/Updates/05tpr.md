#### CLU Workshop on Total Physical Response ####

Robert, Ryan, and Meg organized and taught a two-day workshop at the Comunidad Ling&uuml;&iacute;stica Uspanteka in San Miguel Uspant&aacute;n. The focus of the workshop was using Total Physical Response (TPR) for teaching indigenous languages. On the first day of the workshop, participating bilingual educators learned the theory behind TPR. On day two, those participants split into small groups, worked out a lesson plan, and then taught the rest of the attendees. Nearly 40 bilingual educators who teach in Uspanteko and K'iche' participated in the event. Be on the lookout for future papers and presentations based on this work.
