#### UVG Workshop in Practical Phonetics ####

Robert and Ryan, in concert with Dr. Pedro Mateo Pedro, organized a three day workshop on pratical phonetics at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Campus Altiplano. Topics included basic acoustic phonetics, IPA, principles of recording, and an introduction to phonetics software (e.g., Praat). The workshop was well attended, with speakers of more than 5 different Mayan languages, including, of course, Uspanteko.
